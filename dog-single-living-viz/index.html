        <h1>Do More Dogs Live Where More People Live Alone?</h1>
        <p>A data visualization story exploring borough-level patterns in New York City.</p>

    <!-- Hypothesis -->
    <section class="content-block">
        <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
        <p>
            Neighborhoods with higher percentages of single-person households tend to have higher dog presence.
            This project explores that relationship at the borough level using sampled dog licensing data.

        <h2>Data Sources</h2>
        <ul>

            <li>American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates: Household Composition (B25044)</li>

        <h2>Visualization I — “Two Cities, One Pattern”</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
            This dual spatial treemap abstracts NYC boroughs into blocks. 
            Block shading represents the percentage of single-person households, while circle size represents
            the share of dogs in the sample. Darker blocks and larger circles indicate higher values.
        </p>
        <img src="treemap.png" alt="Dual spatial treemap showing shading for single households and circle size for dog density.">
        <p class="caption">
            Areas where darker shading and larger circles overlap suggest boroughs where living alone and dog presence
            are both relatively high, hinting at a shared spatial pattern.

    <!-- Visualization II: Borough Distribution Bars -->
    <section class="content-block">
        <h2>Visualization II — Borough Distribution Comparison</h2>
        <img src="viz1.png" alt="Bar chart comparing percent of single households and percent of dogs by borough.">
        <p class="caption">
            This chart compares each borough’s share of single-person households to its share of dogs in the sample.
            Manhattan stands out with high values on both; Brooklyn shows many dogs but a lower single-household share.

    <!-- Visualization III: Scatterplot -->
    <section class="content-block">
        <h2>Visualization III — Scatterplot Relationship</h2>
        <img src="scatterplot.png" alt="Scatterplot of percent single households versus percent dogs by borough.">
        <p class="caption">
            Each point represents a borough, plotting % single-person households on the x-axis and % dogs in the
            sample on the y-axis. The upward trend suggests a loose positive relationship between living alone
            and dog presence, though the pattern is not perfect.

    <!-- Outliers -->
    <section class="content-block">
        <h2>Outliers & Exceptions</h2>
        <img src="outlier.png" alt="Scatterplot highlighting Brooklyn as an outlier.">
        <p class="caption">
            <strong>Brooklyn</strong> is a clear outlier: it has a high share of dogs despite a lower share of
            single-person households. In contrast, <strong>Staten Island</strong> and <strong>the Bronx</strong>
            sit slightly below the trendline—moderate single-person households but lower dog density.
            These exceptions suggest that factors like housing type, culture, and amenities also shape where dogs live.

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <section class="content-block">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Overall, the visual evidence points to a general pattern: boroughs with more people living alone tend to
            show more dogs in our sample. At the same time, outliers like Brooklyn, Staten Island, and the Bronx
            highlight the limits of a single explanation and hint at the layered social and spatial forces behind
            pet ownership in the city.
